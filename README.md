# Malware Detection and Analysis with Ghidra and Python

This project provides a comprehensive script for analyzing binaries loaded in Ghidra to detect potential malware activities. The script utilizes Python to examine suspicious API calls, process creation, DLL interactions, registry manipulations, and file handling to help identify malicious behavior.

## Overview

Malware analysis requires detailed examination of binary files to uncover hidden or suspicious actions. This tool assists in identifying malware behaviors by:
- Analyzing memory blocks and loaded libraries.
- Scanning for suspicious function calls, such as process manipulation and registry changes.
- Flagging potentially malicious API calls used in process injection, privilege escalation, and persistence.

The accompanying Python script simulates a malwareâ€™s functionality, including registry modification, file encryption, and process creation, providing a controlled example of malware behaviors.

## Features

- **Suspicious API Detection**: Identifies known suspicious API calls (e.g., `CreateProcess`, `RegSetValueEx`, `DeleteFile`) that indicate potential malware.
- **Process and Service Call Analysis**: Examines calls related to system processes and services that could indicate system manipulation.
- **Memory and DLL Analysis**: Reports on memory sections and loaded libraries to identify executable and loaded memory areas.
- **Registry and Command Pattern Scanning**: Searches for patterns in registry and command executions, marking suspicious entries.
- **Simulated Malware Actions**: Demonstrates malware behaviors including file encryption, process spawning, registry editing, and DLL interactions.

## Requirements

- **Ghidra**: Ensure Ghidra is installed for binary analysis.
- **Python 2.x**: For running the script.
- **ctypes** and **winreg** libraries (included with Python on Windows).

## Usage

1. **Setup**: Open Ghidra and load the binary you want to analyze.
2. **Run the Script**: Run the Python script within Ghidra's script manager:
   - You will be prompted to provide a path to save the analysis report (e.g., `C:/path/to/report.txt`).
3. **Review the Report**: The analysis report provides details on suspicious API calls, registry manipulations, and service interactions.
4. **Simulate Malware Behavior**: Execute the Python malware simulation script to observe potential malware techniques.

## Code Structure

### Main Analysis Script (Ghidra)

- `analyze_memory_dlls_and_processes`: Analyzes memory sections and imported DLL functions for suspicious patterns.
- `analyze_imports`: Flags suspicious API calls.
- `analyze_process_calls` and `analyze_service_calls`: Detects suspicious process and service-related calls.
- `analyze_registry_and_commands`: Scans for suspicious registry changes and command executions.

### Simulated Malware Script (Python)

- **Process Creation**: Uses `CreateProcessW` to simulate process spawning.
- **File Manipulation**: Demonstrates file encryption and deletion.
- **Registry Modification**: Alters registry to simulate malware persistence.
- **Service Simulation**: Simulates creation of a malicious service.
- **DLL Interaction**: Loads DLLs (e.g., kernel32, user32) to simulate system interaction.
